You will plan a 33-second animated explainer shown as ONE continuous living scene (no cuts): a cut-away side view where the viewer watches the thing work, step by step.
Work like a careful designer. Think in this order:

1. PRINCIPLE: the real cause. Why does it work? One or two true sentences.
2. CHAIN: 5 to 7 links of cause and effect, in the order they happen ("because A, B happens").
3. CAST: 4 to 8 objects the viewer must see. ANY topic can be drawn: "emoji" gives any recognisable object (animal, organ, planet, vehicle, tool, food, person, building), "path" draws any custom shape, and there are ready parts for water, pipes, wires, wheels, particles (fire, smoke, steam, sparks, bubbles, snow), meters and more. All part types: {', '.join(CATALOG)}.
   Also choose the SETTING that truly fits the topic: where it really happens. A kitchen, home or workshop topic is indoors: preset "clean" or "lab" with ground "floor" (no hills, no trees). Space has no ground. Only use outdoor presets for things that happen outdoors.
   The STAR of the video (the thing the topic is about) must be drawn LARGE and, when the secret is inside it, shown as a cut-away so the viewer sees inside.
4. LAYOUT: give every cast member a box on the stage: x0, x1, y0, y1. Stage: {STAGE_TEXT}
   - The layout must SHOW the principle. If gravity matters, the source is physically higher than where the water ends up. If something is underground, it is below y=0.
   - Put the objects in the order of the chain, left to right, so the camera travels one way.
   - Solid machines and buildings stand on dry ground, never inside water. Boxes of different objects must not overlap (a pipe or wire joins them).
   - EXCEPT things that truly sit inside another thing (clothes in a drum, a seed in a fruit, a piston in a cylinder): give them "inside": "<id of the container>" and place their box inside the container's box. Draw the container as a cut-away so the inside is seen.
5. STEPS: exactly 7. Each step = one spoken sentence + the ONE cast member that visibly changes to prove it (fills, drains, flows, spins, grows, lights up, appears).
   - "say": ONE energetic sentence, 8 to 13 plain words, spoken like an excited friend. Strong action verbs (slams, rockets, squeezes, bursts, snaps), never dull ones (is, has, creates, forms, allows). At least 5 sentences end with "!". Step 1 is a hook question. Step 7 is the payoff that ties it to the viewer's life.
   - True, general facts only. No numbers you are not sure of. No medical or money advice.
   - Be creative: choose a surprising, concrete angle, not a textbook definition.

Here is the approved PLAN. Now build the exact scene description from it.
{json.dumps(plan, ensure_ascii=False)}

STAGE: {STAGE_TEXT}
Parts are drawn in list order (later parts cover earlier ones): sky first (with the preset from the plan's setting), then scenery, ground (if any), the main objects, labels last.

PARTS YOU MAY USE (only these). Use "emoji" for any recognisable object and "path" to draw custom shapes; never leave a main subject as a plain box:
{catalog_text()}
Any part may have an "id". Give every cast member's main part the same id as in the plan. A part that sits inside another gets "inside": "<container id>".

ANIMATION: any number field can be a fixed number or keyframes [[time, value], ...]. The value holds before the first and after the last keyframe and moves smoothly between.

STEPS: copy the 7 steps from the plan (label, say, shows) and use exactly these times: {', '.join('step %d: %.1f-%.1f' % (i + 1, a, b) for i, (a, b) in enumerate(TIMES))}.

DESIGN RULES (a checker enforces every one):
1. Proof: in each step the part named in "shows" must have keyframes that change INSIDE that step's time, and nothing important should move before its own step.
2. Camera: a list of [time, x, y, zoom]. x is the centre of the picture, y is the height shown a little below the middle. zoom 0.62 shows about 1160 units across, 1.0 shows 720, 1.6 shows 450.
   Start wide at time 0 (show the whole stage), move to each step's "shows" part and zoom in so it is large (1.1 to 2.0), end wide at {DURATION}.
3. Physics: add "flows": [{{"from":[x,y],"to":[x,y],"by":"gravity"|"pump"|"pressure"}}] for every pipe or stream. Gravity flows must go DOWN. A pump flow needs a pump part. Pressure can only lift water to below its source height.
4. Connections: every pipe and wire must start and end touching the things it joins, or run off the edge of the stage (x=-360 or x=680) if it comes from outside. Mains water is "pressure", not gravity.
5. Machines, wheels, pumps and houses stand on dry ground, never inside a body of water. Water never floats: it sits in a container, behind a wall, or in the ground.
6. Houses, towers, trees and plants stand on the ground (y=0) or on top of a shape.
7. Labels: CAPITALS, at most 16 letters, each with "show" keyframes so it fades in during its own step and out again. Never more than 2 labels at once. No labels in step 1.
8. Sounds: "sfx" is a list of [time, name, loudness 0.3-1.0, optional value], at least 10, at least one in every step, timed to the action.
   With an optional length in seconds: {', '.join(sorted(SOUNDS_DUR))}. With an optional pitch: {', '.join(sorted(SOUNDS_FREQ))}. Plain: {', '.join(sorted(SOUNDS_PLAIN))}.
9. Make it alive: at least 8 parts that change over time; water levels, pipe progress and flow, spinning wheels, growing plants, lights, arrows.
10. The star of each step must be BIG: at least 110 px on screen (an emoji of size 120 at zoom 1.0, or size 70 at zoom 1.7), near the centre, and in the middle of the screen height (not under the caption at the top).
11. No clutter: objects never sit on top of each other; scenery (trees) stays away from the action. 22 to 34 parts in total. Write compact JSON.
12. Emoji must show EXACTLY the thing meant. A whole corn cob is not a kernel; a pan with an egg is not an empty pan. If no emoji is exact, draw the thing yourself with path, ellipse, circle, rect and poly (for example a kernel = a yellow ellipse; a cut-away = an outline with the inside drawn in). Things that travel get x and y keyframes (or an orbit). Use particles for fire, smoke, steam, sparks, bubbles, dust.

Return JSON with keys: "title", "principle", "duration": {DURATION}, "music": {{"bpm": 118}}, "flows", "steps", "camera", "sfx", "parts".
